    "(4)The first thing I did was use the constructor method to figure out what sort of information I wanted to include for each object. After deciding on a few categories, I decided to divide those categories into three separate functions for basic information, course enrollment information, academic information, and disciplinary record. This way so that I could create unique methods within each funciton for the different bits of information. I started off easy with a large print statment for the basic information, and then I thought of ways I could incorporate more concepts for the other categories. For example, I incorporated for loops to iterate through list parameters. I also included conditionals to account for certain differences in student records, such as an absence of a disiplinary record."
